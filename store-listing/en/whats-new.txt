This update focuses on Password Vault usability and flow run recovery.

- Improved password input binding UX in flows, with clearer vault-based guidance for password fields.
- Added a reset flow for forgotten Password Vault passwords (vault contents cannot be recovered; you can reset and rebind).
- Improved handling for broken vault bindings after reset, with clearer prompts to rebind missing passwords.

Flow run experience improvements:
- When a flow needs the vault while the side panel is closed, Ladybird can now show an in-page vault unlock prompt and continue from the current step after unlock.
- Clearer feedback when unlock is cancelled or interrupted by page refresh/navigation.
- Popup step UI is more visible and easier to confirm.

Also includes stability and UI/i18n polish across recent screens.
