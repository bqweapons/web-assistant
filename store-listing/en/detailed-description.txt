Ladybird helps you customize websites with no-code UI elements and user-triggered automation flows.

WHAT IT DOES

- Add buttons, links, tooltips, and areas to pages without writing code.
- Build flows that can click, input, wait, navigate, log, branch, loop, and show popup confirmations.
- Hide distracting page elements with Hidden rules.
- Review saved site data in Overview and manage import/export in Settings.

CORE FEATURES

Elements / Flows / Hidden / Overview / Settings
- Manage injected UI elements and automation flows from the side panel.
- Use Overview to inspect saved site data per site and remove data when needed.

Password Vault
- Save reusable passwords for flow input steps in a locally encrypted Password Vault.
- Password fields are protected from plain-text flow storage by policy.
- If a flow needs a vault password while the vault is locked, Ladybird can prompt for vault unlock directly on the page and continue the current step.

Import / Export
- Export saved configuration as JSON.
- Export can optionally include Password Vault data after vault-password confirmation.
- Import supports restoring saved configuration and optional vault data.

Multi-language UI
- English / Japanese / Simplified Chinese interface support.

TYPICAL USE CASES

- Add quick action buttons to frequently used websites
- Reuse form-filling flows for repeated tasks
- Add semi-automated flows with popup confirmations
- Hide banners or repeated UI sections you do not want to see

PRIVACY & SECURITY

- Data is stored locally in chrome.storage.local unless you export it.
- Password Vault data is encrypted locally.
- Ladybird does not upload your configuration data to a telemetry backend.
- Exported files are your responsibility to store securely.
- If you forget the vault password, vault contents cannot be recovered and must be reset.

LIMITATIONS

- Some sites may change DOM structure frequently, which can break selectors.
- Some sites with strict CSP or highly dynamic pages may reduce injection stability.
- Cross-origin iframe automation is limited and may not work in all cases.
- Automation only runs based on your configuration and page state; site compatibility is not guaranteed.
